# Trivia - React Native Quiz Game

Trivia is a simple Quiz Game, with 10 true or false questions, developed in React Native. This game is been developed as a Code Challenge for G2i, to showcase the abilities and impress.

This project is a super helpful kit to kick-start your next React Native project, as it provides a lot of references and best practices for creating a React Native project from scratch. Some of these are:
- Clear project structure
- Usage of functional components
- Handling shared stypes and themes
- Flux architecture - Using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
- Routing and navigation - Using [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- Unit tests - Using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- Code Linting - Using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Airbnb's JS Linting](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) guidelines
